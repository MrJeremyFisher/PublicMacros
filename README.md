# PublicMacros
My (public) macros for use on CivMC. Message me at MrJeremyFisher#0500 if you have any questions about setting any of these up or want to request that I make a script.
There is probably a ton of redundant code in these as I made them while learning JSMacros, so feel free to contribute!

PSA: Most of these macros are (currently) built for forge. I cannot guarantee their functionality on fabric or anything else.
