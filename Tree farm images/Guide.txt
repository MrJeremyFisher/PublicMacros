Only harvest the farm using an unenchanted diamond axe.
Ensure that the glass panes seen in the image are placed 9 blocks above the dirt on which saplings are planted.
Ensure that when you start harvesting, the but has adequate saplings for the whole farm in it's inventory.
The farm uses the same ice-slab-sign water based collection system as the crop farm.
